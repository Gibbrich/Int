  description: "Hey! Could you help me? My name is Bob, I\u2019m mechanic. I owed
    money to Tommy, one of the local moneylenders. He sent his thugs to take all of
    my tools. Please, kick their asses for me and I will reward you.  Be careful,
    they are quite dangerous. It will be better for you to find some heavy \u201Cargument\u201D
    nearby. "
